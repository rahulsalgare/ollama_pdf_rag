(Nasdaq: META) today reported \\x00nancial\\n\\nresults for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2024.\\n\\n\"We continue to make good progress on AI, glasses, and the future of social media,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\\n\\nfounder and CEO. \"I\\'m excited to see these e\\x00orts scale further in 2025.\"\\n\\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Highlights\\n\\nThree Months Ended December 31,\\n\\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\\n\\nIn millions, except percentages and per share amounts\\n\\n2024\\n\\n2023\\n\\n% Change\\n\\n2024\\n\\n2023\\n\\n% Change\\n\\nRevenue\\n\\nCosts and expenses\\n\\nIncome from operations\\n\\nOperating margin\\n\\nProvision for income taxes\\n\\nEffective tax rate\\n\\nNet income\\n\\nDiluted earnings per share (EPS)\\n\\n$ 48,385 25,020 $ 23,365 48 % $ 2,715 12 % $ 20,838 $ 8.02\\n\\n$ 40,111 23,727 $ 16,384 41 % $ 2,791 17 % $ 14,017 $ 5.33\\n\\n21 % 5 % 43 %\\n\\n(3) %\\n\\n49 % 50 %\\n\\n$ 164,501 95,121 $ 69,380 42 % $ 8,303 12 % $ 62,360 $ 23.86\\n\\n$ 134,902 88,151 $ 46,751 35 % $ 8,330 18 % $ 39,098 $ 14.87\\n\\n22 %\\n\\n8 %\\n\\n48 %\\n\\n— %\\n\\n59 %\\n\\n60 %\\n\\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Operational and Other Financial Highlights\\n\\nFamily daily active people (DAP) – DAP was 3.35 billion on average for December 2024, an increase of 5% year-\\n\\nover-year.\\n\\nAd impressions – Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 6% and 11% year-over-\\n\\nyear for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\\n\\nAverage price per ad – Average price per ad increased by 14% and 10% year-over-year for the fourth quarter\\n\\nand full year 2024, respectively.\\n\\nRevenue – Revenue was $48.39 billion and $164.50 billion, representing increases of 21% and 22% year-over-\\n\\nyear for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have\\n\\nincreased 21% and 23% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\\n\\nCosts and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $25.02 billion and $95.12 billion, representing increases\\n\\nof 5% and 8% year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively. The fourth quarter costs\\n\\nand expenses included a favorable impact of $1.55 billion due to a decrease in the accrued losses for certain\\n\\nlegal proceedings.\\n\\nCapital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on \\x00nance leases, were $14.84\\n\\nbillion and $39.23 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2024, respectively.\\n\\nCapital return program – Share repurchases of our Class A common stock were nil and $29.75 billion, and\\n\\n1\\n\\ntotal dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.27 billion and $5.07 billion for the fourth quarter\\n\\nand full year 2024, respectively.\\n\\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were\\n\\n$77.81 billion as of December 31, 2024. Free cash \\x00ow was $13.15 billion and $52.10 billion for the fourth\\n\\nquarter and full year 2024, respectively.\\n\\nLong-term debt – Long-term debt was $28.83 billion as of December 31, 2024.\\n\\nHeadcount – Headcount was 74,067 as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 10% year-over-year.\\n\\nCFO Outlook Commentary\\n\\nWe expect \\x00rst quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $39.5-41.8 billion. This re\\x00ects 8-15% year-over-\\n\\nyear growth, or 11-18% growth on a constant currency basis as our guidance assumes foreign currency is an\\n\\napproximately 3% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates. This also\\n\\nre\\x00ects the e\\x00ect of lapping leap day in the \\x00rst quarter of 2024. While we are not providing a full year 2025\\n\\nrevenue outlook, we expect the investments we are making in our core business this year will give us an\\n\\nopportunity to continue delivering strong revenue growth throughout 2025.\\n\\nWe expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-119 billion. We expect the single largest driver of\\n\\nexpense growth in 2025 to be infrastructure costs, driven by higher operating expenses and depreciation(1). We\\n\\nexpect employee compensation to be the second-largest factor as we add technical talent in the priority areas of\\n\\ninfrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative arti\\x00cial intelligence (AI), as well as regulation and compliance.\\n\\nWe anticipate our full year 2025 capital expenditures will be in the range of $60-65 billion. We expect capital\\n\\nexpenditures growth in 2025 will be driven by increased investment to support both our generative AI e\\x00orts and\\n\\ncore business. The majority of our capital expenditures in 2025 will continue to be directed to our core business.\\n\\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 12-15%.\\n\\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including legal and regulatory headwinds in the\\n\\nEU and the U.S. that could signi\\x00cantly impact our business and our \\x00nancial results.\\n\\n________________________\\n\\n(1) In January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated useful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this change in accounting estimate will reduce our full year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. This is factored into our outlook.\\n\\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\\n\\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of\\n\\nMeta\\'s earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.atmeta.com,\\n\\nalong with the earnings press release, \\x00nancial tables, and slide presentation.\\n\\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website.

These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to di\\x00er from the\\n\\nresults predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x00led with the SEC on October 31, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at\\n\\ninvestor.atmeta.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our\\n\\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this\\n\\npress release is January 29, 2025, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions\\n\\nthat we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result\\n\\nof new information or future events.\\n\\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled\\n\\n\"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report \\x00led with the SEC.\\n\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated \\x00nancial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance\\n\\nwith generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP \\x00nancial\\n\\nmeasures: revenue excluding foreign exchange e\\x00ect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange e\\x00ect, and\\n\\nfree cash \\x00ow. The presentation of these \\x00nancial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a\\n\\nsubstitute for, or superior to, \\x00nancial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are\\n\\ncautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP \\x00nancial measures as an\\n\\nanalytical tool. In addition, these measures may be di\\x00erent from non-GAAP \\x00nancial measures used by other\\n\\ncompanies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing\\n\\nspeci\\x00c information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP \\x00nancial measures.\\n\\nWe believe these non-GAAP \\x00nancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the\\n\\n\\x00nancial performance of our business, enable comparison of \\x00nancial results between periods where certain items\\n\\nmay vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics\\n\\nused by management in operating our business.\\n\\nOur non-GAAP \\x00nancial measures are adjusted for the following items:\\n\\nForeign exchange e\\x00ect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31,\\n\\n2024 using the prior year\\'s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S.\\n\\ndollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\\n\\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on \\x00nance leases. We subtract both purchases of\\n\\nproperty and equipment, and principal payments on \\x00nance leases in our calculation of free cash \\x00ow because we\\n\\nbelieve that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to\\n\\nsupport our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a \\x00nance lease. We\\n\\nbelieve that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand\\n\\nunderlying trends in our business. Free cash \\x00ow is not intended to represent our residual cash \\x00ow available for\\n\\ndiscretionary expenditures.\\n\\nFor more information on our non-GAAP \\x00nancial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures,\\n\\nplease see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\\n\\n4\\n\\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.
